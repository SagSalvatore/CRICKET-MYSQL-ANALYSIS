#Explanation:
#Impact Calculation:The impact is calculated by the formula:
#(RunsScored * 1.5) + (WicketsTaken * 25) + (Catches * 10) + (Stumpings * 15) + (RunOuts * 10).
#AVG() Function:The AVG() function computes the average impact per match for each player.
#RANK() Window Function:The RANK() function is used to rank players by their average impact. Players with the same average impact will share the same rank.
#HAVING Clause:#The HAVING clause ensures that only players who have participated in at least 3 matches are included.
#Sorting:#Finally, the results are ordered by Rank to list the players from highest to lowest average impact.
#Output:This query will return a list of players ranked by their average impact, considering only those who have played at least three matches. Players with the same average impact will share the same rank.

#Q-20 Identify the top 3 matches with the highest cumulative total runs scored by both teams.
#Rank the matches based on total runs using window functions. If multiple matches have the same total runs, they should share the same rank.

#Explanation:JOIN Statements:
#We're joining the Matches, Performance, and Players tables.
#The Matches table provides the match details.
#The Performance table provides the runs scored by players.
#The Players table helps in filtering and grouping runs based on teams (Team1 and Team2). 
#SUM with CASE:For each match, we're calculating the total runs scored by both teams (Team1 and Team2).
#The SUM(CASE WHEN p.TeamName = m.Team1 THEN perf.RunsScored ELSE 0 END) calculates the runs for Team1.
#Similarly, SUM(CASE WHEN p.TeamName = m.Team2 THEN perf.RunsScored ELSE 0 END) calculates the runs for Team2.
#Window Function (RANK())-The RANK() function ranks the matches based on the total runs scored by both teams in descending order.
#GROUP BY:We're grouping by MatchID, MatchDate, Team1, and Team2 to get the total runs for each match.
#LIMIT:The query limits the results to the top 3 matches.
#The query will return the top 3 matches with the highest cumulative runs scored by both teams, 
#and they will be ranked accordingly using the RANK() window function.

#Q-21 For each player, calculate their running cumulative impact score across all matches theyâ€™ve played, ordered by match date.
#Include only players who have played in at least 3 matches.

#EXPLANATION
#Explanation of Changes:
#CTE PlayerMatchCount:
#This common table expression calculates the number of distinct matches for each player (COUNT(DISTINCT MatchID)).
#The HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT MatchID) >= 3 clause ensures that only players who have played at least 3 matches are included.
#Main Query:We join the Players, Performance, and Matches tables.
#The ImpactScore for each match is calculated using the provided formula.
#The running cumulative impact score is calculated using the window function SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY pl.PlayerID ORDER BY m.MatchDate). This ensures the cumulative score is calculated in the correct match order for each player.
#Ordering:
#The results are ordered by PlayerID and MatchDate to ensure that the cumulative impact score is computed in the correct order.
#Expected Output: PlayerName: The name of the player.,MatchID: The ID of the match.
#MatchDate: The date of the match.
#ImpactScore: The individual impact score for the match.
#CumulativeImpactScore: The running cumulative impact score for the player across all matches, ordered by match date.
#Why This Approach Should Work: Cumulative Calculation: The use of window functions ensures that we correctly compute a running total for each player based on their matches.
#Player Filtering: The HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT MatchID) >= 3 ensures we only include players who have played in at least 3 matches.
