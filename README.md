# üèè Cricket Analysis SQL Case Study

## üåü Overview
This project is a comprehensive **SQL-based analysis** of cricket match data, focusing on player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes. The goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from cricket data by solving **21 complex SQL queries**, ranging from identifying the best-performing players to analyzing team dynamics and match results. This case study demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases, write efficient SQL queries, and extract actionable insights from raw data.
